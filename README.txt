These files provide MATLAB code and data in connection with the article 

Richter, H. Spectral dynamics of guided edge removals and identifying transient amplifiers for deathâ€“Birth updating. J. Math. Biol. 87, 3 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-023-01937-1

The mat-files all_XX_YY.mat are the adjacency matrices of the YY-regular graphs with size XX used as the input to the algorithm.



The m-file trans_amp_iter_00 finds the potential transient amplifiers by the iterated perturbation method, it calls the m-files remove_edge_tree1, remove_edge_tree4, connect_test, large_filter1 and small_filter1. 

It uses the function findRemeetingTimes.m
