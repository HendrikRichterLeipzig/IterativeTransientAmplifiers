These files provide MATLAB code and data in connection with the article 

Richter, H. Spectral dynamics of guided edge removals and identifying transient amplifiers for death–Birth updating. J. Math. Biol. 87, 3 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-023-01937-1

The mat-files Trans_XX_Y.mat are the adjacency matrices of the amplifiers constructors of Y-regular graphs with size XX.



The m-file find_trans_amp1 finds the potential transient amplifiers by the perturbation method 

It uses the function findRemeetingTimes.m
